## Hiya 👋

Im a _13_ year old total beginner in frontend. 

🔭 Im currently working on absolutely nothing apart from school. 

🌱 Im learning blender (slowly), HTML, CSS and soon Javascript. 

✨ Im interested in running local AI models and linux. 

🖥️ I use Macos 15 on a 2024 mac mini and Arch linux (Archinstall) on my laptop (4GB intel pentium gold)

🤖 I beleive AI should be a tool not a resource and should not be writing whole files worth of code. I have tried "vibe coding" personally i didnt like it as i learnt **nothing**.
